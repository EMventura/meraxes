Todo list
=========

☐ refactor merger code
☐ conserve cold gas in merger events
☐ refactor insitu-SF code
☐ add gas_infall to repo and call from evolve_galaxies
☐ change baryonic growth function to use gas instead of fb*dMvir
    ☐ limit the SFR to cold gas reservoir
☐ use Sobacchi baryon frac formula
☐ global emissivity calculation


To consider
===========

☐ merger driven star burst?
☐ proper cooling and tracking of hot halo gas
    ☐ this will need matalliticity tracking as well
